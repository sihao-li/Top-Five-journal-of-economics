Abstract : This article examines the evolution of research topics published in top five economics journals using advanced textual analysis methods. We implemented Structural Topic Models (Roberts, 2014) on our database of abstracts from the top five journals, which we constructed using web scraping techniques from the RePEc platform. Our findings indicate that economics has evolved, with an increasing resurgence of empirical methods and a significant decline in theory, particularly in general equilibrium.
